# Frontend Mentor - Newsletter sign-up form with success message

![Design preview for the Newsletter sign-up form with success message coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hello! Thanks for coming to one of my projects!

This one is another challenge made by me, from the website Frontend Mentor. 
The website project has a form functionality that shows to the user if the sign up was a success, or not. 

Basically, I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

You can see my other projects on my other repositories, I'm sure you'll also like them! 
See you later! :wave:
